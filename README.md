POC: Dr.CJ Meadows <cj.meadows@spjain.org>

### Getting Started
```
git clone <this-repository>
```

**note**: master is the staging branch, deploy is the deployment branch


### Development

Create a new branch with name that conveys what you are working on
```
git branch <name-of-the-branch> master
git checkout <name-of-the-branch>
```
and start coding!

### Pull Request

Check [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) out
if you don't know what is a pull request/what for or how to create one.

Create a remote tracking branch after committing your changes
```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Open your pull request and someone will review your code and merge

**!Note!: Always PR to staging branch, deploy branch is meant for integration**
